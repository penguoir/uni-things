When I realised that I could not use my Scratch-designed platformer to
start a video games company, aged 11, I decided to learn how to program
in Python and Java. This led me to undertake various coding projects (see
https://orimarash.com/) in contexts as varied as business and Physics. In
2018, I created a beta website for ExpressTrack, a package tracking
company. I wrote scrapers which took data from couriers’ websites, such
as FedEx and UPS, and displayed the information clearly for the user. I
created a test suite to make sure my new updates would not break old
ones, especially as the volume of traffic was 250 000 requests a year.
Buoyed by the google rankings increase and the satisfaction derived from
this project, I have decided to pursue a degree in Computer Science as I
am keen to deepen my knowledge of networking, algorithms and AI.

My experience at ExpressTrack helped me secure a place at Summer
School at the Weizmann Institute of Science in July 2019. I worked on a
research project which focused on detecting super-radiance in particles
which could be used to detect dark matter. My team created a program
which took data from a data logger, analysed it and then displayed
information about the different photomultiplier tubes, so that they could be
calibrated. This taught me how to work in a team of programmers as up
until now I had been working by myself. I gained insight on working in a
group and I am excited to participate in further group projects throughout
the Computer Science course.

Due to my love of Physics, I applied and was selected for the Imperial
College Summer School which was centred around modelling simple
harmonic motion using Python. My role in our small team was to program
an algorithm which analysed videos of a pendulum swinging to find the
vector from the starting point. This enabled us to calculate exactly how
much the pendulum swings, in order to calculate dampening. Finding that
the algorithm was effective was highly rewarding and led to us reaching
second place.

I have learnt so much about Computer Science by engaging with these
projects that I delivered a TEDx talk on Project-Based Learning (PBL) and
how schools can use it to teach more effectively (see
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1_AlvWJiH4). I have been a tutor for
web development and Computer Science A-level using the PBL method.
For my Computer Science A-level coursework, I am designing and building
a Learning Management System built for PBL. I have interviewed potential
users (students, teachers and admin) to make sure it is optimised for them.
Furthermore, I was paid to add to a feature to the school’s existing LMS to
enable Heads of Department to monitor homework setting of teachers.
I enjoy making new links between Maths and Computer Science such as
when I applied Djikstra’s algorithm to routing. I completed Grow with
Google’s ‘Machine Learning Crash Course’ which gave me practical
knowledge of machine learning. I have an interest in cybersecurity and
attended an online lecture about Cloud Security Strategies. I was struck by
the depth required to safeguard security, from every processor to the entire
organisation.

Using the connections and resources offered by HackClub, an online
community providing tools and contacts, I co-founded my school’s
HackClub where we teach students how to code through working on
projects once a week. I am currently working on a website which
aggregates hackathons and programming problems. The goal is to have a
website which helps students learn how to code through doing, rather than
theory. Outside of computing, I enjoy cooking Italian cuisine. I have
attained Grade 8 in Piano and enjoy playing Electric Bass.

I am an enthusiastic Computer Scientist and look forward to being able to
build ever more exciting programs as my knowledge grows.
